# Storybook Chromatic & Storybook Chroma

A CLI to connect your Storybook with Chromatic or Chroma.

<img width="100%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3070389/63930825-5abe5f00-ca54-11e9-8320-7ee949823458.gif" alt="">

## Install

```sh
yarn add storybook-chromatic
```

## Usage

You can use this package normally, which means installing it and adding a script called `chromatic` to your `package.json`

```
  "chromatic": "chromatic",
```

But alternatively (and this is useful for testing) you can use npx:

**Use a git branch**:
```sh
npx -p chromaui/chromatic-cli#master chromatic --dev
```

**Use a debug version on npm**:
```sh
npx -p storybook-chromatic chromatic
```

Using npx has pros and cons:

- üëç You'll never be out of date, you'll use the latest version every time, never have to worry about upgrading this.
- üëç You don't need this package as a dependency, and don't need to install it during local development
- üëé This will add a delay when you actually do want to run this, like in your CI, delaying feedback.

### Usage in a github action

There are examples here: [/.github/workflows](/.github/workflows).

Do not run this based on a github pull_request event. If you do, the commit and branch will get reported wrong, use [https://github.com/chromaui/action](https://github.com/chromaui/action) instead.

### Main options

```
--app-code="<your app code>"
```

You can also use the environment variable: `CHROMATIC_APP_CODE`

### Storybook options

```
--build-script-name [name], -b  The npm script that builds your Storybook [build-storybook]
--storybook-build-dir, -d <dirname>  Provide a directory with your built storybook; use if you've already built your storybook
```

Deprecated options (for tunneled builds):
```
--script-name [name], -s  The npm script that starts your Storybook [storybook]
--exec <command>, -e  Alternatively, a full command to run to start your storybook
--do-not-start, -S  Don't attempt to start or build; use if your Storybook is already running

--storybook-port <port>, -p  What port is your Storybook running on (auto detected from -s, if set)
--storybook-url <url>, -u  Storybook is already running at (external) url (implies -S)'
--storybook-https  Use if Storybook is running on https (auto detected from -s, if set)
--storybook-cert <path>  Use if Storybook is running on https (auto detected from -s, if set)
--storybook-key <path>  Use if Storybook is running on https (auto detected from -s, if set)
--storybook-ca <ca>  Use if Storybook is running on https (auto detected from -s, if set)    
```

These options are not required, this CLI is 0-config if you have a `build-storybook` script in your `package.json`.

### Chromatic options

```
--allow-console-errors  Continue running chromatic even if some stories throw an error
--auto-accept-changes [branch]  Accept any (non-error) changes or new stories for this build [only for <branch> if specified]'
--exit-zero-on-changes [branch]  Use a 0 exit code if changes are detected (i.e. don't stop the build) [only for <branch> if specified]
--exit-once-uploaded [branch]  Exit with 0 once the built version has been sent to chromatic [only for <branch> if specified]
--ignore-last-build-on-branch [branch]  Do not use the last build on this branch as a baseline if it is no longer in history (i.e. branch was rebased) [only for <branch> if specified]'
--preserve-missing  Treat missing stories as unchanged (as opposed to deleted) when comparing to the baseline'
--no-interactive  Do not prompt for package.json changes
--only <component:story>  Only run a single story or a glob-style subset of stories (for debugging purposes
```

### Debug options

```
--skip  Skip chromatic tests (mark as passing)
--list  List available stories (for debugging purposes)
--ci  This build is running on CI, non-interactively (alternatively, pass CI=true)
--debug  Output more debugging information
```

### Environment variables

This package will load any variables from a `.env` file if present

## Issues

If you encounter issues with the CLI please report them via the in-app chat (Intercom widget) or at https://github.com/chromaui/chromatic-cli/issues. Thanks!

## Contributing

Because of the nature of this package: it being a connector between Storybook and a web service, you may need an app code to test this locally. Just send us a message at opensource@hichroma.com or sign up for an account!

All contributions are welcome!

## Future plans:

- We'd like to unify this so there's just a single package on npm.
- Migrate to Typescript
- Deprecate all the Storybook options in favor of a sane `--config` flag

## Publishing

We publish with a script:

```sh
./scripts/publish.js
```

You can pass any flags to this you'd normally be able to pass to `npm publish`, such as `--dry-run` or `--tag="alpha"`.

Before publishing we check if the current user has permissions and if the version isn't already on npm

## Compatibility & versioning

Compatibility is guaranteed between this package and Chromatic like so:

- Production Chromatic ensures it‚Äôs compatible with what‚Äôs on NPM
- What's on the master branch is equal to what's published on NPM
- This package ensures it‚Äôs compatible with production Chromatic

To facilitate upgrading in the future, removing and adding features, this is the process:

- Any new features will have to be on Chromatic production before they could be used in this package
- We can feature flags to be able to test new functionality
- Chromatic production can not remove any features this package depends on until after the usage has been removed from this package.
  Plus a grace period so users have upgraded
